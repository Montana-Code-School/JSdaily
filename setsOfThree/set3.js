  Exercise 2: Difference of the sum squares

  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
    1(sq) + 2(sq) + ... + 10(sq) = 385
  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
